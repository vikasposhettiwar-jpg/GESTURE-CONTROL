# Gesture Control Presenter 🎮🖐️

Control your Google Slides presentations using hand gestures through your laptop camera using Computer Vision and AI.

This project uses:

* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* PyAutoGUI

to detect hand gestures and convert them into presentation controls like:

* Next Slide
* Previous Slide
* Start Presentation
* Exit Presentation

# 📦 Installation

## Step 0 - Ensure Python is installed

For Linux and Mac system, please use `python3` instead of `python` in the commands below </br>

Check if python is installed and available in your system PATH on VSCode Terminal (Terminal → New Terminal):
```bash
python -V
```

---
## Step 1 — Download the code

```bash
https://github.com/shivam-kotwalia/gesture-control/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

---

## Step 2 — Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3 — Download Hand Landmarker Model

```bash
python setup_models.py
```

---

# ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

---

# Close the application

Press Ctrl+C in terminal to close the application

# 💻 macOS Permission Setup

For keyboard control to work on macOS:

Go to:

System Settings → Privacy & Security

Enable permissions for:

* Accessibility
* Input Monitoring

Allow access for:

* Terminal
  OR
* VS Code
  OR
* PyCharm

Without these permissions, the app cannot control Google Slides.

# 🎯 How to Use

1. Open Google Slides in Chrome
2. Start slideshow mode
3. Run the Python application
4. Show gestures in front of webcam
5. Control slides hands-free
